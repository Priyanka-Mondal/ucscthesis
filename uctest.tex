\begin{abstract}
One of the primary design objectives of distributed systems is to eliminate centralized trust.
%
Various approaches are used to achieve this goal. 
%
%Quorum replication techniques are widely popular in this regard.
%
Quorum replication techniques are popularly used for distributing trust among multiple parties, simultaneously eliminating the risk of a \emph{single point of failure}. 
%
This method not only boosts system availability but also improves overall integrity.
%
Information flow control is another tool for ensuring both data integrity and confidentiality in distributed computations.
%
Encryption is a widely popular technique used to maintain confidentiality of data on transit 
and data at rest on the cloud.
%

This thesis presents a general purpose programming framework, called Flow Limited Authorization for Quorum Replication (FLAQR), that enables programmers to write secure decentralized applications, using quorum replication and information-flow-control. 
%
FLAQR utilizes the Flow-Limited Authorization model (FLAM) to implement information flow control. 
%
Two key contributions of FLAQR is the incorporation of availability policies into the FLAM algebra, and  introduction of secure \emph{fault-tolerant} language constructs. 
%

Later, FLAQR is extended with \emph{secret-sharing} language constructs, resulting in an enhanced version called  FLAQR$^+$.
%
Next, the fault-tolerant language constructs of FLAQR are implemented as a Haskell library called FlameChor. This library also incorporates availability polices to FLAME--a Haskell library that implements FLAM algebra.%, and information-flow-control into choreographic programming.

Finally, this thesis presents the first set of searchable encryption constructions that are both I/O-efficient, and ensure forward and backward privacy.
%
Searchable Encryption, also popularly known as \emph{encrypted search}, deals with design and
implementation of practical cryptographic porotcols to perform queries on encrypted data. 
%maintaining efficiency and (user's) privacy. 
User privacy and efficiency are the two main areas of focus while designing a 
searchable encryption scheme.
%
Forward and backward privacy are the two essential privacy guarantees for these schemes, which protect against attacks like file injection, and ensure compliance with privacy regulation laws.
%
On the other hand, the efficiency of a searchable encryption scheme can be enhanced by optimizing its
I/O operations.
%
While some previous works claim that both forward privacy and I/O efficiency simultaneously can not be achieved, this thesis demonstrates otherwise.
